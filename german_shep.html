 <h5 style ="color:purple"> Cooper is a retired 👮🏾‍♂️ police dog, and he also served in Afghanistan as a bomb dog 🎖🐈, as well as his three sisters, who give their lives in the line-of-duty🙁. Cooper is more than a well-trained and mile mannered eight ago German Shepherd. Who would do well with an owner with special needs🦮 (I.e., 👨🏽‍🦯blind,🧏🏾 hearing impaired, or the👵🏾 elderly) and someone willing to take care of him 😇. Cooper isn't all business. However, he is kind🐶 and playful. He is not just a pet, but a companion 🐾. Cooper is mature but still loves to give, so all he already needs is a home 🏠, so please give a dog a bone🦴. Must be 21 or older with a valid ID🪪. Background checks are required before adoption. Thank you 🤙🏿😇.
